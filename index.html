        <h2> Basic Info</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Brian Yu's website, hosted by your's truly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born in Frmeont, California, but Unlike many Chinese people borned in the US, I have spent most of my childhood and teenage years in Shanghai, China, exposed to many traditional Asian culture and values. I'm also fluent in Chinese! On the side you can see a picture of myself while I was working on this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website was a simple project by me mostly written mostly in javascrpit. I used this framework called three.js and played around a little to create this interactive environment that resembles a 3d field. I have yet to integrate this to the mobile device so stay tuned.
        </p>

      <section class="light" id="Projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Projects are an important thing for cs students and thus I have done many in the past. Some course work and others not, including but not limited to -- simple websites like this, path finding algorithms in Pacman(CS188 in berkeley search it up), a brand new operating system that we wrote from scratch in c, a course recommendation tool for transfer students in the California Community College system, an online testing platform, a series of c injections to hack into a space station(cybersecurity), and much more to come.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>   
          I have moved back to Fremont since highschool and went to UC Berkeley for my undergraduate education, majoring in electrical enginnering and computer science. I have graduated with a bachelors of science in EECS at UC Berkeley in 2024.
        </p>
          
          While being in the US, I still have many interests and ties with the Asian culture, and to experience what it's like to complete education in Asia, I have participated in an exchange program in Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan during 2023. 
          I was studying Japanese and Economics mainly in their school of international liberal studies (SILS) and have achieved a japanese proficiency level of about N3(Daily converse) during my half year stay in japan. My goal is to achieve N1 in japanese in the coming years.

      <section class="left" id="Experience">
        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3>AVP Technology</h3>
        <p>
            During 2019, I interned at AVP Technology, a company based in Fremont, Califronia that specializes in refurbishing wafer film equipments. From photolithography tools to etching/cleaning tools, I have helped their engineers on site assemble/disassemble these very important(and expensive) machines to improve their design and renew parts. I later interned in GIS solutions, a similar company based in Suzhou, China which focuses on lithographic machines as an extension from this experience.
        </p>
        <h3>UC Berkeley Lab Tutor</h3>
        <p>
          During my time at Berkeley, I was engaged in student course staff in the EECS department at Berkeley. I helped students understand key concepts in CS and EE during lab hours and assist them in any problems they might have.
        </p>
        <h3>Ohlone College Computer Science Tutor</h3>
        <p>
          My mother has always emphasized the importance of education and I have also discovered my passion for tutoring before my time at Berkeley. I was enrolled in Ohlone College in Fremont, and I have assisted hundreds of students about concepts in CS and math.
